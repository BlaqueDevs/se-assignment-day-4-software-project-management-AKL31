## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
Agile vs. Waterfall
Feature	Agile	Waterfall
Approach	Iterative & flexible	Linear & rigid
Changes	Easy to adapt	Difficult to modify
Testing	Continuous	Done at the end
Delivery	Frequent releases (sprints)	One final delivery
Best For	Dynamic, evolving projects	Fixed, well-defined projects
Pros & Cons
Methodology	Pros	Cons
Agile	Fast changes, early issue detection	Hard to estimate cost & timeline
Waterfall	Clear structure, predictable costs	Inflexible, late testing risks
Conclusion:

Use Agile for flexible, evolving projects.
Use Waterfall for structured, well-defined projects.
## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
When to Use Agile vs. Waterfall
Project Type	Best Methodology	Example
Unclear or evolving requirements	Agile	Startups, AI development, mobile apps
Frequent customer feedback needed	Agile	E-commerce platforms, SaaS products
Fast-paced, iterative development	Agile	Social media apps, gaming software
Well-defined, stable requirements	Waterfall	Government projects, banking systems
Regulatory or compliance-heavy	Waterfall	Healthcare systems, aerospace software
Fixed budget & strict timelines	Waterfall	Construction software, ERP systems
Conclusion:

Agile is best for dynamic, user-driven projects.
Waterfall is ideal for structured, predictable projects.


## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?

What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)?
A Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) is a hierarchical decomposition of a project into smaller, manageable tasks.

Why is WBS Useful?
Improves Planning & Organization – Breaks work into clear steps.
Enhances Task Management – Assigns responsibilities effectively.
Aids in Tracking Progress – Helps monitor deliverables.
Reduces Complexity – Simplifies large projects.
## 7. What are the benefits of developing a detailed project schedule, and how can Gantt charts assist in this process?
